When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository is useful when you want to share your code with other people, get contributions and is also a good way to backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually you have control about what you want to expose to other people.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork, at GitHub, is a copy of another repository. It's used when you don't have permission to change the code of another person.
Clone is a copy of a repository to your computer.
Branches are some points at the time where you bookmark your code. You can create differente braches to not change
a special branch or you can merge branches too.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can know what is the exactly code other people are working on.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
To collaborate without using Git or GitHub would be necessary to exchange several files often.
Only at the first few steps it would be easier, but after that it would become a mess.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A separece branch is useful to test experimental features. Master branch is easier to work with, but you have to keep it always working fine and clean.
