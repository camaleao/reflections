How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Maybe staging area is a temporary place to use before you know what will be in the final project (repository).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can check the changes before commit them.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful when you have to make some experiences with your code without change the original files.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It's better to understand the whole sctructure and it can show me inaccessible branches.
