Viewing a difference between two versions helps to compare the version that was working with the new version.
If the new version is not working is possible to check all the changes and easily spot what went wrong.

Access the entire history of a file can make understand better the code and always keep it improving.

The pro of choosing when to create a commit is that you can create a version control of logical block of changing.
The con is that maybe you lose something because you forget to save or there are many changes.

Control systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit because they are intended for code programming.

The command git log shows the log of all commits made.
The command git diff compare two commits.

Version control makes me more confident to make changes because I can easily revert it to old working code and
git can indicates me where are the differences to quick spot where is the error.

I need to use Git at the Android course, but first I need to finish this one.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Maybe staging area is a temporary place to use before you know what will be in the final project (repository).
